<p>Retail grocers everywhere will find this little book
of especial value for study and reference. It is all
meat for the salesman who realizes that success in
trade these days depends upon knowing where the
goods he handles were produced, how to judge their
qualities, how they are prepared for market, and
what are their uses. How to sell, the market conditions,
etc., are continuously set forth in the weekly

<p>Allspice is the dried unripe berries of a tree of the
myrtle family, the pimento, known botanically as
Eugenia pimenta, or Pimenta officinalis. It’s an evergreen
tree some 20 to 30 ft. high, with a slender,
straight, upright trunk, much branched at the top;
the bark is smooth, gray and aromatic; the leaves—which
when fresh abound in essential oil—are 5 in.
long, of an oblong shape and deep shiny green color;
the blossoms—which appear in July and August—are
white and fragrant; the berries (sometimes called
corns), which form on the disappearance of the
flower, are picked unripe, altho fully grown, they
are of a greenish-purple color. After picking, the
berries are dried in the sun or in kilns until dark
brown and then separated from the stalk. The dried
berries are light, brittle, of roundish form and crowned
with the remains of the flower calyx in the shape
of a raised, seared-like ring; each berry contains two
dark-brown flattish, kidney-shaped seeds. If allowed
to ripen, the berries lose their aromatic flavor and
become merely sweet and pulpy. Only in Jamaica—where
it is cultivated in plantations called Pimento
walks—does the pimento tree grow to perfection,
altho attempts are made to cultivate it in other West
India islands and South America. It is thought to
combine the flavor of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg,
hence it is called allspice.</p>

<img src="images/i_p005.png" width="368" height="563" alt="" />
</div>

<p><b>Uses</b>—Its chief use is for culinary purposes. It is
a powerful irritant, good for dyspepsia, flatulency,
gout, hysteria and toothache. It is often employed
to disguise the nasty taste of medicine. Allspice
yields volatile oil by distillation, which is used as a
flavoring in alcoholic solution, is of a brownish-red,
clear appearance, and has the odor and taste of pimento,
but is warm and more pungent. A green
fixed oil has the burning aromatic taste of pimento
and is supposed to be the acrid principle. A tincture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
from allspice has been praised as an application in
chilblains.</p>

<p><b>Substitutes.</b>—The Mexican spice, called Pimento
de Tabascol is somewhat larger and less aromatic
than Jamaica pimento. The berries of Pimento acris,
(bayberry) whose leaves are used in the manufacture
of bay-rum. The Carolina allspice—calycanthus
florides, a shrub 6 or 8 ft. high, with an odor somewhat
like strawberries. Japan allspice—chimonanthus
frangrans—which grows in Japan, and wild allspice—lindera
benzoin—known also as spice-wood,
fever-wood, benjamin-bush—a member of the laurel
family growing in the United States. To secure uniformity
of color these inferior kinds are often colored
with Armenian bole, a kind of red clay from Armenia,
and they are also often mixed in ground allspice,
in addition to the stalks of the pimento. A kind of
red pimento from Salonica is also used as an adulterant.
During the civil war, when pimento was
high in price, a substitute was made up of clove-stems,
wasted rye, a little cayenne pepper, and some
cassia; this was very acceptable, altho there was not
an ounce of pimento in it.</p>

<span class="subhead sep">Cayenne Pepper Is Made from This Branch of the
Nightshade Family—Descriptions of the Various
Varieties of Capsicum—Tabasco
Pepper Sauce</span>
</h2>
</div>

<div class="sep"></div>

<p>The capsicum is a genus of plants of the nightshade
family (Salanacea) that grows luxuriently in
all tropical countries and many species of which are
cultivated in the temperate zone. Capsicum or Red
Pepper is of American origin for these reasons:
Fruits so conspicuous, so easily grown in gardens
and so agreeable to the palates of the inhabitants of
hot countries would have very quickly diffused thruout
the old world, if they had existed in the South
of India, as it has sometimes been supposed. They
would have had names in several ancient languages,
yet neither the Romans, Greeks nor the Hebrews were
acquainted with them. They are not mentioned in
ancient clinic books. The islands of the Pacific did
not cultivate them at the time of Cook’s voyage in
spite of the proximity of the Sunda Isle where Rumphines
mentions their very general use. The Arabian
physician, Ebn Baithar, who collected in the
13th century all that eastern nations knew about
medicinal plants, says nothing about them. Probably
the first known history of cayenne pepper in
Europe is that given by Martyr, who writes of Columbus
bringing it home in 1493 and speaks of it being
more pungent than that from Caucasus, probably
referring to the Oriental black pepper. About a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
century later, Gerarde writes of its being brot
into Europe from Africa and Southern Asia and being
grown in European gardens. Probably the first
record of its use is that by Dr. Chanca, who was physician
with Columbus’ fleet in 1494, and who alludes
to it as a condiment used in dressing meats, dying
and other purposes, as well as a medicine. From
the ground dried seeds and pericarp of certain varieties of capsicum
we get cayenne pepper, so-called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
from Cayenne, in French Guiana, S. A., whence it
was imported by the French. Cayenne pepper is also
called Calicut and Napaul, the names of places of
export, and it was known as Guiana pepper over 300
years ago. The derivation of the word “Capsicum”
is uncertain; it may be from Kapto, hot, on account
of its pungent taste, or from capsa, a box, or chest,
referring to the form of its fruit. The plant grows
from 1 ft. to 6 ft. high and is fairly well branched;
the flowers are white or greenish-white; the fruits
of the several species are of various forms, round,
oblong, cordate or horned, and contain a number of
flattish seeds. The seeds after the removal of the
pericarp, and then thoroly washed and dried, are
entirely devoid of acidity and pungency. The hotter
and drier the soil, the more acrid and pungent the fruit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;">
<img src="images/i_p008.png" width="352" height="599" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Used in moderate quantities, capsicum or cayenne
pepper, promotes digestion and so prevents flatulence.
The natives of Brazil boil the capsicums and
dip their manioc bread in it, making a kind of fiery
soup. They are extensively used in India in compounding
curries and chutneys. In Bengal the natives
make an extract from the small capsicum chilies
of about the consistency of molasses. The bell peppers
are pleasant stuffed with meats, fish, other
vegetables, etc. The sweet and mild kinds fed to
birds are said to improve their plumage.</p>

<p>C. Annum is the most common species and contains
a great many varieties, among them the Pimiento
(not Pimento or allspice) commonly known
as Spanish red peppers or morrons, also Paprika,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
or Hungarian sweet pepper. This species is never
found growing wild.</p>

<p>C. frutesens is sometimes called goat pepper and
is generally described as the true cayenne. Its
leaves are from 3 in. to 6 in. long by 2 in. to 3½ in.
wide, the fruit is red, obtuse or oblong accumminate,
¾ to 1½ in. long and ¼ to ¾ in. in diameter. It is
very acrid and pungent. It is only cultivated in the
tropical regions, as the seasons in the temperate
climate are not long enuf to mature the fruit.</p>

<p>C. baccatum is ovate of sub-round and about ¼ in.
in diameter. C. baccatum have been known in the
English gardens since 1731.</p>

<p>C. facticulatum, also known as Mexican chilies, is
a shrubby plant of Sierra Leone, and grows in Zanzibar;
also known as small chilies, or red cluster
peppers. The fruit, which grows erect, is oblong
linear, not quite an inch in length and of a deep red
orange color. Another variety, which are mostly
consumed locally, have larger red and yellow fruit.
Zanzibar capsicums or chilies, are dirty looking, of
a brownish-red color and very hot. A variety from
Japan are bright red, not so pungent as the other
growths, but of finer aroma.</p>

<p>C. ceresiforme, the fruit is spherical, sub-cordate,
oblate or occasionally pointed. The flesh is firm,
from 1-12 to ½ in. thick, and very pungent; from
the shape of its fruit it is called the cherry capsicum,
or pepper.</p>

<p>C. grossum, originally from India, grows 2 ft. high,
with a few branches and large leaves 3 to 5 in. long,
the fruit is large, oblong or ovate, and is known as
bell pepper; it is mostly used for stuffing and pickling;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the skin being thick, soft and tender and of a
mild flavor.</p>

<p>C. abberciatum, with ovate fruit about 2 in. long.
While this variety is used to some extent for pickling,
it is cultivated more as an ornamental plant.</p>

<p>C. longum grows to about 3 ft. high with comparatively
few branches, the fruit is often a foot long
and 2 in. in diameter. The flesh is thick and flavor
mild.</p>

<p>C. Acumination is about 2½ ft. high. The fruit,
which is small, grows both erect and pendent.</p>

<p>C. Conordes, with oblong linear fruit, which grows
erect, is very acrid and pungent. It is known as tabasco
capsicum or pepper. Bird pepper, bird’s-eye
chilies, red-bird pepper, etc., are commercial names
given to the mild, sweet varieties of capsicum
on account of their being fed to birds. Nepaul
pepper, commercial name for capsicum imported
from that place in India. Nepaul pepper has
an odor and flavor resembling orris root and a pod
the color of amber when dried. It is most esteemed
as a condiment, being aromatic and appetizing, and
not so acrid or biting as is most cayenne. Paprika,
commercial name for the mild, sweet varieties of
capsicum, chiefly grown in Hungary, Spain, Portugal,
Jamaica, Japan and Zanzibar.</p>

<p>Japanese pepper is the fruit of Xanthoxylum, an
entirely different genus of plants to the capsicum
family. The fruit capsules when bruised are agreeably
pungent and aromatic. It is much esteemed as
a condiment in China and Japan.</p>

<p>Tabasco pepper sauce originated with Mr. E. McIllhenny,
of New Iberia, La., in 1868, from a variety
of capsicum in which the fruit grows erect, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
brot by a soldier friend of Mr. McIllhenny from Tabasco
in Mexico after the close of the Mexican war.</p>

<p>Tabasco catsup originated with Mr. George Bayle
of St. Louis, Mo. The base of it is said to be equal
proportions of powdered capsicum and essence of tomatoes.</p>

<p>Ground cayenne pepper soon loses its bright color
when kept too long or exposed to the light, and becomes
dingy in appearance, so it is not always wise
to judge by looks alone, as red ocher, turmeric, mustard,
rice, sawdust, salt, brick dust, etc., have been
found in cayenne pepper.</p>

<p>The large fruits or pods are commercially known
as capsicums, and the smaller ones as chilies. The
term pepper is a misnomer as applied to this spice.</p>

“cassia,” botanically speaking, has nothing whatever
to do with the aromatic bark which we call
by that name, but refers to a genus of plants of the
bean family, from which are derived the dried senna
leaves, an infusion of which our mothers induced us
to take by the bribe of a piece of candy, altho we
had “tummy ache” for a brief space afterwards. The
word “cinnamon” is derived from two Malayan words
“cassia” from the Greek word “kasian,” which occurs
in Psalms XLV-8, and elsewhere in the Bible, where
it is supposed to refer to the aromatic bark of the
present day, was afterwards tacked on. That cassia
(the bark) was known in biblical times is well authenticated.
It is mentioned in a Chinese herbal
published in 1700 B. C. under the name kwei.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of cinnamon is in a list of
offerings by Seleneneus Callinieus, king of Syria, and
his brother, Antiochus Hierax, to the temple of Apollo
at Miletus, 243 B. C. Among the gifts mentioned
are: “2 lbs. of cassia and a like quantity of cinnamon.”
From this it appears there was then a recognized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
distinction between the two barks. We do
know that the cassia was obtained from China, but
the source of the cinnamon is unknown, unless it
was obtained thru the Chinese from Ceylon, the inhabitants
of those countries being in frequent intercourse
in ancient times, for the earliest mention we
have of cinnamon as a production of Ceylon is by
Kazwini, an Arab writer of about 1275 A. D.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.0625em;">
<img src="images/i_p014.png" width="369" height="568" alt="" />
</div>

<p>That cinnamon and cassia were extremely analogus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
is proved by the remark of the Greek physician
Galen (130–200 A. D.): “The finest cassia differs
so little from the lowest quality of cinnamon, that
the first may be substituted for the second, provided
a double quantity of it were used.” With this
brief historical sketch we will now endeavor to
point out the differences between the two barks.</p>

<p>In the first place the word “cinnamon” refers solely
to the cinnamon zeylanicium plant of Ceylon,
where it is found growing wild, and was first brot
under cultivation by De Koke in 1770. Here again,
as with cloves, mace, etc., the Dutch tried to monopolize
the trade. The giving away of a plant was
punishable by flogging and the destruction of a plant
involved the penalty of death. The tree grows to
the height of 20 or 30 ft., having a trunk 12 to 18
inches in diameter; the leaves are of a thick leathery
texture, 4 to 6 inches long, very smooth and
shining on the upper surface, glaucous with prominent
netted veins on the under side, and are traversed
by 3 or 5 ribs. The flowers are greenish-white
and appear in clusters of threes. The fruit
is an oval berry, not unlike an acorn in shape and
color. The tree flowers in January and the fruit
ripens in August. When the branches are peeled
the finest sticks are said to be derived from the liber
of the middle-sized branches, an inferior sort from
the younger shoots, and that which is procured from
the thickest branches is considered of little worth.
The peeling commences in May and lasts until November.
The shoots or branches, usually about ½-inch
to ¾-inch in diameter and from 3 to 5 ft. long,
are cut off with a curved pruning knife, tied up in
bundles and carried to the peeling sheds. The bark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
is removed with a small, round-pointed knife, with a
small projecting rib or cutter placed at right angles
to the edge of the knife. With this knife the bark
is split lengthwise of the stock. It is then carefully
loosened from the wood for a short distance on
either side of the slit. A similar incision is made on
the opposite side and the bark is finally removed.
The bark is then put in piles, covered with scrapings
and matting and left for about two days, during
which time a sort of fermentation takes place,
which greatly facilitates the separation of the outer
part of the bark from the cuticle and epidermis,
which is carefully done by scraping with a small,
curved knife, having a slightly serrated edge. This
process is called piping. The piper sorts the bark
as he scrapes it. He selects a slip suitable for the
outer layer, about 3 ft. long, and packs within it 6
or 8 other pieces, all about the thickness of vellum
paper—a mark which always distinguishes Ceylon
cinnamon from cassia. They are then rolled up together
and exposed to the sun to dry. It now resembles
a tight roll of paper, the best quality being
firm and compact, of a golden yellow color, smooth
on both outer and inner surfaces. The cheaper
grades are not so carefully made, having many short
pieces in the pipes or quills and not so much attention
is paid to obtain uniform size and color. At
Colombo it is sorted into three kinds by government
inspectors. The two finest kinds are exported, the
third with the broken pieces being reserved for obtaining
oil of cinnamon. It is formed in bales about
90 lbs. each and wrapped in double cloths made of
hemp, and not, as stated by some, of the cocoa tree.</p>

<p>Guava bark, soaked in the water left after the distillation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
of cinnamon oil and rubbed over with cinnamon
oil, is sometimes placed inside good cinnamon
quills and then it takes a man of Solomon’s wisdom
to detect the fraud.</p>

<h3>Cassia</h3>

<p>Cassia, under the name of Kwei, is mentioned in
the earliest Chinese herbal—that of the Emperor
Shena-ming, who reigned about 2700 B. C.; in the
ancient Chinese classics, and in Rh-ya an herbal
dating from 1200 B. C. In the Hai-yao-pen-ts’ao,
written in the eighth century, mention is made of
Tien-chu Kwei. Tien-chu is the ancient name for
India, perhaps the allusion may be to the cassia bark
of Malabar. In connection with these extremely
early references to the spice, it may be stated that
a bark supposed to be cassia is mentioned as imported
into Egypt together with gold, ivory, frankincense,
precious woods and apes, in the 17th century
B. C. The accounts given by Dioscondes, Ptolemy
and the author of the Periphes of the Erythrean
Sea, that cinnamon and cassia were obtained from
Arabia and eastern Africa; and we further know
that the importers were Phoenicians who traded by
Egypt and the Red Sea with Arabia, and it was imported
hither from southern China.</p>

<p>Cassia, according to Marshall and others, is the
bark of the old branches and trunks of the cinnamon
zeylanicium, while others assert that it is the bark
of an entirely different species, namely, cinnamon
cassia, a native of China, but also grown in Java.
This view is the more probable, as no cassia is exported
from Ceylon, it almost all coming from Canton.
Regents have also very different effects on the
infusion and oil of these two barks, which conclusively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
shows that they are obtained from different
species. Cassia comes in bales, 2 to 4 lbs., bound by
strips from the bark of some other tree. The pipes
or quills are thicker and rolled once or twice, and
never contain thinner pieces within; the diameter
of the bark is much thicker, harder, and not as carefully
scraped. The color is a deeper browinsh-fawn
color. The taste is more acridly aromatic, pungent
sweet, at the same time more powerfully astringent
yet muclignious. Cassia is often substituted for
cinnamon. It is adulterated with cassia lignea, the
bark of a degenerate variety of cinnamon zeylanicium
growing in Malabar, Penang and Silhet.</p>

<p>Other varieties of cassia are: Saigon cassia, the
bark of an unknown species which appeared in commerce
about 1875. The outer bark is not removed,
has a gray or grayish-brown color, is covered externally
with whitish blotches, warts or wrinkles.</p>

<p>C. Aromaticum is believed to be the cinnamon of
China and Cochin China, growing in the provinces
of Kwantung and Kwangsi. The leaves are very
much larger than the Ceylon tree, hang down from
the stalks and have never more than three ribs.
This is the species that yields the cassia buds.</p>

<p>C. Tamala is a native of India, wild in Derwanee
and Gongachora. It is cultivated in the gardens of
Rungpoor. The dried leaves have an aromatic taste.</p>

<p>C. Loureirii grows in the lofty mountains of Cochin
China, to the west towards Laos, Japan. The
flowers of cassia are produced by this species. The
old and young branches are worthless, but the middle-sized
shoots produce a bark that is superior to
that of Ceylon. None of it is exported.</p>

<p>C. Culilawan is a native of Amboyna. The bark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
when dry is aromatic like cloves, but less pungent
and sweeter. It is used by the natives of Amboyna
as an internal medicine and as a stimulating linament.</p>

<p>C. Rubrium grows in Cochin China, and contains
an essential oil, smelling of cloves, but not so agreeable.</p>

<p>C. Sintoc is a tree about 80 ft. high, growing in
the Neilgherry mountains, India, and the higher
mountains of Java. The bark is of the same quality
as the Amboyna cassia, but not so agreeable. It is
more bitter and powdery when chewed.</p>

<p>C. Xanthaneuron is a native of the Papuan islands
and the Moluccas. The bark when fresh is very fragrant,
but it soon loses its quality.</p>

<p>C. Nitidum is a native of India. It is a shrub or
small tree.</p>

<p>C. Javanicum grows in Java and Borneo. It is a
tree of about 20 to 30 ft. high. The dried bark is
of a deep cinnamon brown color; more bitter than
the Ceylon cinnamon, and the leaves when rubbed
have a sharp aromatic odor.</p>

<p>Cinnamon of the Ceylon type is cultivated in Guyana,
the Isle of St. Vincent, Cape de Verde, Brazil,
the Isle of France, Pondicheny, Guadaloupe and elsewhere.
There is, however, no probability that the
tree will succeed as an article of commerce that has
not the hot, damp insular climate and bright light
of Ceylon.</p>

<p>The barks of all these different species, including
that of Ceylon, are classed as “cinnamon” in the
pharmacopias of Austria, Germany, Hungary, Russia,
the United States, France, Spain, Denmark and
Switzerland, while in the United Kingdom cinnamon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
must be the bark of the Ceylon plant C. zeylanicium;
the others being classed as cassia.</p>

<h3>Oil of Cinnamon</h3>

<p>Oil of cinnamon is made from the pieces and chips
of the bark, it is of a red-yellowish color. Eighty
pounds of bark yields about 8 ozs. of oil. It is very
stimulating. It is often adulterated with oil of cassia,
oil of cassia buds, oil of cherry laurel, and oil of
bitter almonds—the latter is a very dangerous mixture.</p>

<p>Cinnamon leaves yield an oil resembling oil of
cloves, with which it is often mixed.</p>

<p>The ripe berries of the cinnamon tree yield a
volatile oil, similar to oil of juniper, and from the
root is obtained camphor.</p>

<p>Cassia oil is obtained from the leaves, buds, or
bark. It is of a golden-yellow color, but turns brown
with age. It is considered good for influenza.</p>

<p>Cassia buds resemble nails with heads of different
size and shape, according to the period of growth
when collected.</p>

<p>There is also a kind of wild cinnamon, or cassia,
which grows in Cuba, but its taste resembles more
that of cloves than of cinnamon.</p>

<h2 id="CLOVES" class="sans">CLOVES<br />

<span class="subhead sep">Interesting History With Illustration Showing Flower,
Bud and Fruit—Where Grown and Commercial
Uses</span>
</h2>
</div>

<div class="sep"></div>

<p>Cloves are dried, unopened calyces or flower buds
of the clove tree, Caryophyllus aromaticus, a kind of
myrtle, a native of the Molucca islands. In commerce
they are chiefly distinguished by their place of growth
and rank in the following order: Penang, Bencoolen,
Amboyna, and Zanzibar. In addition to these there
enter into commerce as secondary products, clove
stalks and mother cloves, or the dried ripened fruit.
The bulk of these secondary products are shipped
from Zanzibar.</p>

<p>The clove tree is an evergreen, 15 to 30 ft. high.
It has a thin smooth bark and adheres closely to the
wood, which is a gray color and of little use. The
leaves are 3 to 5 in. long. The upper side and foot-stalk
is red, shading to a dark color, while the under
surface is green. The flowers grow in small bunches
at the extremities of the boughs, very like the flower-buds
of the lilac tree, and all are of a delicate purplish
color. The calyx is long and forms the seed
sack. As the blossoms fade the calyx changes color
from yellow to red. If allowed to remain on the tree
after this the calyx swells like that of the rose. In
this state it loses its pungent properties and is called
mother clove, and is practically of no value as a
choice spice. The cultivated trees are kept pruned
to about 8 or 10 ft. in height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.25em;">
<img src="images/i_p022.png" width="340" height="465" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The harvesting of the flower-buds commences immediately
after they assume a bright red color. Such
blossoms as can be reached are plucked by hand,
while those that grow on the upper branches are
beaten down with bamboo poles and caught in
clothes spread beneath the trees. They are then
dried in the shade or by hanging on hurdles over
slow wood fires—they lose about half their weight
in the drying process. They are usually finished off
in the sun, which gives them a darker color. The
quicker they are dried the less the loss of aroma.
Good cloves have a strong aromatic smell, a hot,
spicy taste and a light brown or tan color. The season<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
for harvesting is from September to March. A
10-year-old tree yields about 20 lbs. of cloves a year,
the yield increasing up to 100 lbs. for a 20-year old
tree.</p>

<p>Penang cloves are from the Straits Settlements.
They are large, plump and of a bright color. Amboyna
cloves are not so large as the Penang and are
of a dark brown color. Zanzibar cloves are smaller
than the Amboyna, a bright reddish color and generally
very dry. Pemba cloves are small and dark
in color and mostly arrive in a damp condition, and
therefore lose weight if kept long.</p>

<p>Cloves have sometimes a portion of their oil extracted,
which gives them a pale, thin, shriveled appearance,
altho they may be freshened up by rubbing
with a little oil or passed off by mixing with good
cloves. Cloves that have been tampered with have
a good proportion of their heads or knobs off; altho
another cause for headless cloves is that they may
have been gathered when too ripe.</p>

<p>Pure oil of cloves is almost colorless, with a faint
yellow tinge and the strong smell and burning taste
of cloves. When old it turns to a reddish brown
color. It has a greater specific gravity than water,
in which it will sink.</p>

<p>Clove stalks and mother cloves are used in the
manufacture of ground cloves and mixed spices. In
Brazil the flower-buds of the tree whose bark furnishes
cloves cassia are often used as substitutes for
true cloves. The clove tree attracts so much moisture
that herbage will not grow beneath its branches
and the clove of commerce has such an affinity to
water that if placed near a vessel of water they will
absorb enuf of the moisture in a few hours to appreciably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
increase their weight. It is said that dealers
often take advantage of this to increase the
weight of their goods and thus enhance their profits.</p>

<p><b>A Little Clove History</b>—This spice was well known
to the ancients and is mentioned by several Chinese
authors as in use under the Han dynasty, B. C. 266 to
220, during which period it was customary for the
officers of the court to hold the spice in their mouth
before addressing the sovereign, in order that their
breath might have an agreeable odor. At this period
the clove was called fowl’s tongue spice. In 1265 A. D.
the price was 12s per lb. In 1609 a ship of the
East India Co., called the Consent, brot 112,000 lbs.
to England which was sold at 5s 6d per lb. As was
the case with nutmegs, the Dutch attempted to control
the business in cloves. With this object in view,
they caused all the clove trees to be destroyed except
those of the island of Amboyna. The natives of
the island were compelled to rear a certain number
of plants each year and also to protect the bearing
trees. The French, however, found a number of clove
trees growing wild in the smaller island, and Poivre,
French governor of Mauritius, who obtained the plant
from the island of Guebi, introduced the clove
tree into that colony in 1770. About 1800 an Arab
named Harameli-ben-Selah took some seeds and
plants from Boubon to Zanzibar and commenced the
cultivation of cloves in that country. The word clove
is derived from the Latin clavus nail, Spanish clavo
and French clou, owing its nail-like appearance.</p>

<h2 id="GINGER" class="sans">GINGER<br />

<span class="subhead sep">Used as a Spice by the Early Greeks and Romans—Plant
a Native of Asia and Grew Wild in
Mexico and Africa</span>
</h2>
</div>

<div class="sep"></div>

<p>As a spice, ginger was used among the early Greeks
and Romans, who appear to have received it by way
of the Red sea, inasmuch as they considered it to be
a production of southern Arabia. In the list of imports
from the Red sea into Alexandra which, in the
2nd century of our era, were then liable to the Roman
fiscal duty, ginger occurs among other Indian spices.
It appears in the tariff of duties levied at Acre in
Palestine, about 1173, in that of Barcelona in 1221,
Marseilles in 1228 and Paris 1296. It was known in
England before the Norman conquest, being frequently
named in the Anglo-Saxon leech-books of the 11th
century as well as in the Welsh “Physicians of Myddvai.”
During the 13th and 14th centuries, it was,
next to pepper, the commonest of spices, costing on
an average 1s 7d per lb., or about the price of a sheep.
Three kinds of ginger were known to Italian merchants
about the 14th century: (1) Belledi of Baladi,
an Arabic name which applied to ginger would
signify country, wild, and denotes common ginger;
(2) Columbonio, which refers to Columbuno, Kolam
or Quilon, a port in Travanore, frequently referred
to in the middle ages; (3) Micchino, which denotes
brot from or by way of Mecca. Marco Polo saw it in
India and China, 1230–1239. John of Montecorvino, a
missionary friar, who visited India in 1290, gives a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
description of the plant and refers to the root being
dug up and transplanted. Nicolo de Conti, a Venetian
merchant, early in the 15th century describes
the plant and a collection of roots he saw in India.
The Venetians received it by way of Egypt, and
superior kinds from India overland by the Black
sea. Ginger was introduced into America by Francisco
de Mondoca, who took it from the East Indies
to New Spain. It was shipped for commercial purposes
from the islands of St. Domingo in 1585, and
from Barbadoes in 1654.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 15.875em;">
<img src="images/i_p026.png" width="254" height="468" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Ginger is the dried, knotty fibrous rhizomes or
tubers—“races” or “hands” as they are called from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
their irregular, palmate form—of the ginger plant
(zinziber officinale) the real roots being the thin
fibers that branch off from the rhizomes.</p>

<p>The plant is a native of Asia, but also found growing
wild in Mexico and East Africa. It is a reed-like
biennial plant, not unlike the iris or flag in appearance.
The leaves are long, similar to those of maize,
growing alternate on a stem 3 to 4 ft. high. The
flowers are borne on a separate stem, 6 to 12 in. high;
they are yellow or blue, according to the quality of
the soil in which they have been grown. The plant
which produces the yellow flower and best ginger is
grown on rich, deep, virgin soil; the other comes
from poorer ground. Ginger is propagated by pieces
of the rhizome being planted in March. The flowers
appear about September, after they have withered
and seeded. The roots are dug up about January.
When left too long in the ground, the rhizomes become
very fibrous, if taken up too soon they are
tender and succulent, so much so that they cannot be
made sufficiently dry to render them fit for export
in the usual commercial form. They are therefore
preserved in sugar. The rhizomes, besides being
classed as “yellow” or “blue,” are also divided into
“plant,” (being the rhizomes from plants of the same
season’s growth), and “ratoon” which are rhizomes
left in the ground from the previous harvest.</p>

<p>Ginger is known in commerce in two distinct forms,
termed respectively as coated or uncoated ginger,—as
having or wanting the epidermis. For the coated
ginger, the races of hands, after being dug up, are
thoroly washed to free them from all the adhering
earth. They are then laid on a canvas or cement
floor, outdoors, to dry by the heat of the sun. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
night they are taken indoors. It takes from 6 to 8
days to thoroly dry them. They are then ready for
shipment. In damp weather they are artificially
dried by an evaporator. In this form ginger presents
a brown, more or less wrinkled or straited, surface,
and when broken up shows a dark brownish fracture,
hard, and sometimes horney and resinous. For the
uncoated ginger the fresh-dug rhizomes, after being
washed, are soaked in water for some time and then
peeled or scraped—a most delicate operation requiring
the hand of an expert. Owing to the peculiar
formation of the races, no machine has yet been invented
that will do the work satisfactorily. The
outer rind or skin is deftly taken off by means of a
common knife, so as not to injure the inner root, as
a loss of the pungent volatile oil, to which ginger
owes its value, would follow and thus impair its commercial
worth. After being peeled the races are
soaked in water over night. In the morning they are
again washed, cleaned and weighed, and then dried
in the same manner as coated ginger.</p>

<p>It requires 3 lbs. of green root to make 1 lb. of dry
root. The purer the water the whiter the ginger.
Sometimes lime juice is added to the wash water,
which gives a whiter root, but as lime juice contains
sugar, it prevents thoro drying and mildew follows.
Ginger is often subjected to a system of bleaching,
or by immersion for a short time in a solution of
chlorinated lime. The white-washed appearance
which much of the ginger has is due to the fact of
its being washed in whiting and water or even coated
with sulphate of lime. Uncoated ginger varies from
single joints an inch or less to flattish, irregularly
branched pieces of several joints, the races of hands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
and from 3 to 4 in. long. Each race has a depression
on the summit showing the former attachment of a
leafy stem. The color, when not white-washed, is a
pale buff. It is somewhat rough, breaking with a
short, mealy fracture, and presenting on the surface
of the broken parts numerous short or bristly fibers.</p>

<p>The best ginger grown comes from Jamaica. It is
of a superior strength, fine flavor and a light, handsome
color. A peculiar trade custom prevails in
Jamaica with regard to ginger, which is not sold by
weight or measure but by the “heap,” and the size of
the heap governs the price and is an indication, to
a certain extent, of the quality and quantity of the
crop. If the heap is small, the price is high; if the
heap is large, then the price is lower. If the races
or hands, are finely shaped and large, there are fewer
in the heap; if small, dark and mealy, the heap is
made larger.</p>

<p>The next best quality is Borneo or Cochin ginger,
which closely resembles in appearance the Jamaica.
It is not, however, so carefully prepared.</p>

<p>African ginger, also termed Bombay or Calcutta,
from the ports of shipment, is darker in color, has a
coarser appearance, a harsher flavor and inferior
aroma to either of the above, but contains a greater
amount of oleoresin than they do and is very pungent.
It is largely used for making ginger beer, essences,
extracts, etc.</p>

<p>Leaf ginger is ginger that has been sliced into thin
flakes.</p>

<p>Green ginger root, is that which has not undergone
any process of cleaning beyond freeing it from the
earth adhering. Imported in casks and used by wine
makers, preservers, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Spent-ginger is whole ginger that has once been
used, then fixed up to resemble good ginger and sold
whole or ground. It does not possess a single one of
the valuable properties of genuine ginger.</p>

<p>China ginger is not imported in a dried state, the
rhizomes being too tender and succulent to thoroly
dry for export. It is preserved or candied. For preserving,
the rhizomes are first scalded, then washed
in cold water and peeled, then boiled in pans for 2 or
3 hours; then transferred to copper pans and boiled
for 2 hours in a mixture of sugar and water—just
sufficient water to cover the roots, 5 lbs. of sugar to
10 lbs. of ginger, the roots having been pierced with
a sharp instrument to enable the sugar to soak into
them. After boiling the ginger is put into large
jars and stands for several days, when it is again
boiled in sugar and water in the same quantities.
After it has become cold it is packed in jars or tins
for export. To crystallize, the same process is gone
thru, only in the final boiling it is boiled until the
sugar become dry.</p>

<p>The Chinese season for preserving ginger is from
July to October. It is nearly all prepared in Canton
and Hongkong. A kind known as Ng Mai Keunig is
preserved in Swaton, from Alpina galanga, but it is
not like the Canton or Hankou ginger and is only
made for native consumption, to be used medicinally
or for cooking. Some of it goes to the Straits Settlement,
but none to Hongkong. Jamaica preserved ginger
is mostly put up in glass bottles. The uses of
ginger are too well known to need repeating.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<p>Mustard was well known to the ancients, but more
in a medicinal way than dietetic. From an edict of
Diocletian, 30 A. D., in which it is mentioned along
with alimentary substances, we must suppose it was
then regarded as a condiment, at least in the eastern
parts of the Roman empire. In Europe, during the middle
ages, mustard was a valued accompaniment to
food, especially with the salted meats which constituted
a large portion of the diet of our ancestors during
the winter. In the Welsh “Meddygon Myddrai” of
the 13th century, a paragraph is devoted to the “Virtues
of Mustard.” In household accounts of the 13th
and 14th centuries, mustard is of constant occurrence;
it was then cultivated in England, but not extensively.
The price of the seed between 1285 and 1340 varied
from 1s 3d to 6s 8d per quarter (21 lbs.), but between
1347 and 1376 it was as high as 15s and 16s. In the
accounts of the Abbey of St. Germain des Pres in
Paris, 800 A. D., mustard is specially mentioned as a
regular part of the revenue of the convent lands.</p>

<p>The essential oil of mustard was first noticed in
1660 by Nicolas le Febre and more distinctly in 1732
by Boerharroe.</p>

<p>The word mustard comes from the Italian, murtard,
which is derived from the Latin must-um, unfermented
grape juice, with which the Italians formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
mixed ground mustard. The Athenians called
it napy; while the Hellenistic name was sinapi, or
sinapy, whence the Latin sinapi, or sinapis, from
which is derived the German word senf. Hippocrates
used mustard in medicine under the name of Vanuit.
The dark seed, which comes from Trieste, Austria, is
called Trieste mustard. Spoken of by Theophnastus,
Galin and others. What is called French mustard, German
mustard, etc., is made of the dressings mixed
with vinegar, garlic and other spices and flavoring
musterial. The form in which table mustard is now
sold dates from 1720, about which time Mrs. Clements,
of Durham, Eng., hit on the idea of grinding the seed
in a mill and sifting the flour from the husk. This
bright yellow farina rapidly attained wide popularity.
The fame of “Durham Mustard” was spread far and
wide, Mrs. Clements traveling to London and principal
cities twice a year taking orders.</p>

<p>There are two species of mustard plants from
which ground mustard is made. The sinapes alba,
white or yellow mustard, and sinapes nigra, brown
or black mustard, is the mustard plant spoken of in
Luke XIII, 19. They are annual herbs, three to 6 ft.
high, with lyrate leaves, yellow flowers, and slender
pods, from one to four inches long, containing a single
row of roundish seeds.</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities incident to the cultivation
of mustard is the fact that two crops of mustard cannot
be raised on the same ground in succession. Another
variety is sinapes arvenus, or wild mustard,
called charlock and used for adulterating; the Sarepta,
the black seed of the sinapes juncea, from the
East Indies, is used for the same purpose. Sarepta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
is called from a city of that name in Russia, in the
government of Saratov.</p>

<p>The brown or black variety is sown in January and
the yellow or white in March, the seed being sown
broadcast and harvested in August. A reaper is used,
cutting the stalks and throwing them in bunches,
where they are left to cure until October. They are
now thoroly dry and are taken to a convenient place,
spread out upon sheets of canvas and rolled with a
heavy roller. The stalks and empty pods are then
raked off, and the chaff and seeds remaining are run
thru a fanning machine, after which process they are
ready to sack and market.</p>

<p>There are two processes in use in making ground
mustard. In the first, the seeds, white or black, or
mixed, are ground to powder and then put thru an
elaborate course of siftings. The product left after
the first sifting is called “dressings” and that which
passes thru is pure mustard flour. This mustard flour
is again run thru a finer sieve, and so on until the
required fineness is obtained. From the dressings
left after the different sievings, the essential oil of
mustard is expressed.</p>

<p>In the other method, the oil is first extracted from
the seeds by hydraulic pressure, which leaves a sort
of cake. This cake is then broken up and pounded in
a mortar. It is then sifted, that going thru the sieve
being a kind of bolted mustard flour. The remaining
bran is then mixed with an equal quantity of wheat
flour, one per cent of cayenne and sufficient turmeric
to give the proper color. This is pounded and treated
as before, the process being continued until there is
no bran left. Then all the different siftings are mixed
together, giving a mixture of about equal proportions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
of mustard and wheat flour, with the cayenne and
turmeric added in proper quantities.</p>

<p>The peculiar pungency and odor, to which mustard
owes much of its value, are due to an essential oil
developed by the action of water on two chemical
substances contained in black mustard seed; one
called sinigrin and the other myrosin. The latter
substance in the presence of water acts as a sort of
ferment on the sinigrin, and it is worthy of remark
that this reaction does not take place in the presence
of boiling water and, therefore, it is not proper to
use very hot water in the preparation of mustard, cold
water only should be used. White mustard seed contains
in the place of sinigrin a peculiar acrid substance
called sinalbin and also a trace of myrosin,
therefore, it possesses very little pungency and it
produces a larger percentage of flour than the black.
The proper blending of these two seeds is necessary
to the production of the best mustard, as the white
has the peculiar ferment within it which develops
to the highest degree the flavor of the black.</p>

<p>The reason for mixing wheat flour, rice flour or
other farina with pure mustard flour is, that owing
to the large amount of oil contained in the latter it
will not keep long, but turns rancid, ferments and
cakes; the added farinas by absorbing a portion of
the oil retards fermentation, decomposition and rancidity.
They should not be looked upon as adulterants,
unless added in too great quantities, and the
price of the mustard should be in proportion to the
added absorbents.</p>

<p>A mean form of adulteration is to mix gypsum and
chrome yellow with the ground mustard seed.</p>

<p>If upon the addition of a small quantity of iodine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
to ground mustard it turns blue, it shows that starch
is present. The ammonia test will show the presence
of turmeric. Every manufacturer has his own particular
formula, and consequently there are many
different qualities, both in the pure mustard and the
compounds. One is composed of 37 per cent brown
and 50 per cent white mustard flour, 10 per cent of
rice flour, 3 per cent of black pepper, a little Chili
pepper and ginger.</p>

<p>Pure mustard oil, as pressed from the seed, is not
pungent and will not blister unless mixed with water.</p>

<p>The English mustard seed is the best in the world.
Of this class 4,995,800 lbs. of seed and 1,307,202 lbs.
of flour were imported during the year 1908. Mustard
seed and flour from Italy is known as Trieste. In the
Lompoe valley, California, some 2,500 acres are under
mustard cultivation, and a small quantity is also
grown in Kentucky.</p>

<p>The uses of mustard are too well known to need
recapitulation. D. S. F. means double superfine.</p>

<h2 id="NUTMEG_AND_MACE" class="sans">NUTMEG AND MACE<br />

<span class="subhead sep">Where the Nutmeg Tree Grows—Yield of Nuts and
Mace and How Prepared for the Market—Uses
in Commerce</span>
</h2>
</div>

<div class="sep"></div>

<p>The nutmeg tree, known to botanists as Myristica
frangrans (sweet smelling) is a native of the Malay
archipelago. The tree, which in the Banda isles
grows to the height of 50 to 60 ft., and in the Straits
to 30 to 40 ft., resembles the pear tree in the shape
of its leaves and fruit. Its flowers are like those of
the lily of the valley in form and size, but are pale
yellow and exceedingly fragrant. There are male and
female flowers, the nutmegs being obtained from the
latter. It is only when the tree is about 6 or 8 years
old that the female tree can be distinguished from
the male, and of the latter only a few are allowed
to remain for fertilizing purposes, the rest being cut
down. The nutmeg tree continues to yield from 70
to 80 years after reaching maturity (8 years).
Each tree on an average will produce 10 lbs. of nutmegs
and 1½ lbs. of mace annually. The fruit is
yellowish, edible drupe, about the size of a peach;
it splits into halves when at maturity—about 9
months from the time of blossoming—exposing a
single seed with a thin, hard shell, surrounded by a
fibrous substance of a crimson color, which, when
dried and shelled becomes the nutmeg. The young
drupes, when young and tender, are often preserved
like jam and are considered the most aromatic and
delicious of conserves. Altho the nutmeg tree has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
ripe fruit upon it at all seasons, there are three
principal periods of harvesting, viz: July, when the
fruit is most abundant, though it yields thin mace;
November, when the mace is thicker, though the nutmegs
are smaller, and March, when both mace and
nutmegs reach their greatest perfection—but as this
season is dry the production is not great.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="max-width: 5.4375em;">
<img src="images/i_p037.png" width="87" height="488" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The usual method of gathering in the Straits is to
collect the ripe nuts that have fallen on the ground.
In the Banda islands, the fruits are gathered in
small, neatly-made, oval bamboo baskets—holding
about 3 fruit—at the end of a long bamboo stick,
which prevents bruising, the baskets being
opened for about half their length on
one side, and furnished with two small
prongs projecting from the top, by which
the fruit stalk is broken, the fruit falling
into the basket. After the pulp—which
is about ½-in. thick, whitish in color, and
tough like candied peel—has been removed
the mace is stripped off by hand.
The shell of the fruit is very hard and
cannot be broken without injury to the
kernel. To overcome this they are put
into receptacles with fine mesh bottoms,
and dried over a slow fire—being turned
from time to time—until the kernel
rattles freely in the shell, a process
which takes about 6 or 8 weeks. This
also kills any weevil which may be at
work in them. They are then carefully
cracked by placing them on a sort of
drumhead made of raw-hide and striking
them with a board or mallet, when the
shells fly off into pieces. Great caution is needed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
shelling, for if too hard a blow be struck it makes a
black spot on the nutmeg, which affects its
value considerably. After being steeped in salt
water several times and again dried they are sorted
according to size and soundness—130 to 140 to the
pound are the lowest priced, 75 to 80 the highest,
and larger nuts are sold at special prices. The
sorting is done by hand, and nothing but sound, perfect
nuts are supposed to be shipped. The broken
and wormy ones are used in manufacturing “nutmeg
butter,” or, as it is commonly but erroneously
called, “mace oil.” They are now limed. There are
two methods of liming in vogue—the dry and the
wet. In the dry process, the nuts have dry lime
powder rubbed over them, either by hand or shaking
in barrels. In the wet process, the nuts are
put into newly-slacked lime and then spread out to
dry, or they are dipped into a kind of lime-pickle,
thick as syrup, made of calcined-shells and salt
water. After being covered with this mixture they
are dried. The process of liming originated with the
Dutch, with a view to preventing the germinating
of the seeds, for which purpose they were formerly
immersed for three months in milk of lime. Again
it is claimed that liming preserves the nuts against
the attacks of maggots and a particular kind or
beetle by stopping up their breathing and chewing
apparatus. A preference is still manifested for limed
nutmegs.</p>

<p>As nutmegs are now seldom shipped by sailing
vessels, but by steamers, thus saving the long-time
voyage, there is no reason why they should not come
unlimed, and then the differences in their natural
complexions and range of variations would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
become familiar and easily recognized. The
liming process hides many imperfect or corky nuts;
nuts which have been riddled with worm holes are
“stopped” with a paste made of flour, oil and nutmeg
powder and then mixed with the sound ones.
Occasionally this paste is moulded into false nutmegs.
Besides this, nutmegs are frequently robbed
of part of their essential oil by distillation in
alcohol—a process called “sweating”—and yet sold as
entire nuts. A small quantity of boracic acid will
accomplish the same purpose as lime, and Paris
white and barytes will serve to mask the identity
as well as the defects. A good nutmeg should have
no worm-holes, be full of oil and cut firm like a piece
of wood, and if a pin is thrust into one the oil
should ooze out on its being withdrawn.</p>

<p>The Penang nutmegs, which are generally not
limed, are considered the best, altho some prefer the
Banda or Batavia, and after these the Singapore.
There is also a demand for an elliptical-shaped nutmeg
of rank flavor, first called long nutmegs, but
now known as Macassars. Another kind of nutmeg
from New Guinea, and known in Germany as “horse
nutmeg,” is from the species Myristica Argentea.
It is of a long and narrow shape. In these the arellus
or mace furrows are less marked and their odor
is not so delicate as that of the true nutmeg.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of wild or inferior nutmegs,
such as: American Jamaica, or calabash nutmeg
(M. monodora), of the custard-apple family, bearing
a large pulpy fruit containing aromatic seeds.
Brazilian nutmeg (cryptocarya moschata) a tree of
the laurel family, producing nutmegs of an inferior
quality. The nut is longer than the true species and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
is sold under the name of long nutmeg. California
nutmeg, a tree of the pine family, called also stinking
nutmeg or stinking yew, from the disagreeable
odor of the leaves and wood when bruised and burned,
and yielding a fruit resembling true nutmegs.
Clove nutmeg, a Madagascar tree of the laurel family,
the fruit a pungent kernel resembling the true
nutmeg and used as a spice. Peruvian nutmeg, a
large tree of the monimiad family, yielding an aromatic
fruit. From Borneo a wild, soapy nutmeg and
mace (M. fatua) are often palmed off as the true
kinds. There is also the Sante Fe nutmeg (Motoba)
from Columbia, S. A., and Ackaway nutmeg, a spice
grown in Guiana, the fruit of Acrodiclidum camard.
Another species, the M. sebefira, is a common tree
in the forests of Guiana, north Brazil, and up into
Panama. It is utilized principally for the oil extracted
from the nuts, obtained by macerating them
in water, the oil rising to the surface, and as it
cools skimmed off. Ackawi nutmegs, used mainly as
a cure for diarrahoea and colic. All these, while resembling
somewhat the true nutmegs and sometimes
foisted on dealers, are of very little real value.</p>

<h3>Mace</h3>

<p>When the mace, a bright-red membraneous substance,
is removed from the nut it is pressed flat between
blocks of wood and left to dry until it has
acquired the right color. The preparation of mace
for the market requires experience rather than technical
knowledge. If packed too green it is liable to
mold, and is subject to attacks from insects, which
render it valueless in commerce. On the other hand,
if it becomes too dry it loses its vitality and also
crumbles into powder when packed. Packers frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
sprinkle the mace with salt water, which
makes it more pliable and at the same time prevents
attacks from insects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.375em;">
<img src="images/i_p041.png" width="358" height="559" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We may here state that nutmegs are divided into
two varieties: The green, which are long and in
which the mace only partially covers the nut; is
darker in color and inferior in flavor and aroma;
and the Royal, which furnishes the finest and best
mace, firm, thick, flexible and oily, and entirely envelopes
the nut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
As with the nutmeg, mace is sometimes deprived
of its essential oil, and mixed with wild mace or
other flavorless matter. Myristica Malabarica,
known under the name of Bombay mace, used to
adulterate the true powdered mace, is much larger
and more cylindrical than the arillus of the true
nutmeg and has several flaps united at the apex,
forming a conical structure.</p>

<p><b>Products</b>—Candied nutmeg and mace, nutmeg
fruits in vinegar or salt, preserved nutmeg fruits,
and nutmeg or mace essence made from the essential
oil of nutmegs (not mace) and rectified spirits.
An essence of mace is also made from 6 oz. mace
and 2 pints cologne spirit, macerated for a couple of
weeks, expressed and filtered thru paper. “Nutmeg
butter”, “butter of nutmeg,” or mace, “concrete oil of
nutmeg,” or “expressed oil of mace,” as it is variously
called, is obtained by subjecting the nutmeg or mace
to a great heat and then squeezing or pressing it in
heavy presses. This substance is of a green color of
the consistency of tallow and of a pleasant smell. A
pound of nutmegs will make 3 ozs. of this oil, but a
transparent volatile oil is obtained by distillation. It
evaporates rapidly on exposure to air. When cold it
becomes somewhat spongy and has a marbled or mottled
appearance. It becomes hard with age and is exported
in small bricks, 10 in. by 2½ in., wrapped in
palm leaves. It is known under several names, as
nutmeg butter, balsam of nutmeg, concrete oil or the
mace oil of commerce, and as Banda soap, sometimes
made from the distilled nutmeg leaves, counterfeited
by using a foreign fatty substance as palm oil, nut,
wax and animal fat, boiled with powdered nutmeg
and flavored with sassafras, which gives it the right
color and flavor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
<b>Uses</b>—Nutmegs, besides their use as a spice or
condiment, are used to relieve sleeplessness when
opium fails and chloral is not advisable. For diarrhoea,
half a drachm in milk is an effective cure.
Butter of mace is used as a liniment and embrocation
for rheumatism and is also a favorite medicine
for low stages of fever with Hindoo doctors.</p>

<p>For ground nutmeg, all the faulty, broken, moldy,
worm-eaten and wild nutmegs are often used.</p>

<p>A little of the history of mace and nutmegs: It
has generally been believed that neither the nutmeg
or mace were known to the ancients. Nutmegs and
mace were imported from India at an early date by
the Arabians, and thus passed into western countries.
Masudi, who appears to have visited England in 916–920
A. D., pointed out that the nutmeg, like cloves,
arcca nut and sandalwood, was a product of the
eastern isles of the Indian archipelago. The Arabian
geographer, Edrisi, who wrote in the middle of the
12th century, mentions both nutmeg and mace as
articles of import into Aden. They are also among
the articles on which duty was levied at Acre in
1180. About a century later another Arabian author,
Kozwim, expressly named the Moluccas as the native
country of the spices under notice. One of the
earliest references to them in Europe occurs in a
poem about 1195, by Petrus D’Ebulo, describing the
entry into Rome of the Emperor Henry VI, previous
to his coronation in 1191. By the end of the 12th
century both nutmeg and mace were found in northern
Europe, even in Denmark, as may be inferred
from the allusions to them in the writings of Harpestring.
In England, mace, though well known, was
a very costly article, its value between 1284 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
1377 being about 4s 7d per lb., while the average
price of a sheep during the same period was about
1s 5d, and of a cow 9s 5d. It was also dear in France,
for in the will of Jeanne d’Evreux, queen of France,
in 1372, 6 ozs. of mace were appraised at the rate
of 8s 3d per lb. In the middle of the 18th century,
the Dutch, with the object of monopolizing the trade
in nutmegs, destroyed all the trees in all the Moluccas
islands, excepting Banda. Nature did not, however,
sympathize with such meanness. The nutmeg
pigeon, found in all the Indian islands, did for the
world what the Dutch had determined should not
be done—carried the nuts, which are their food, into
all the surrounding countries, and trees grew
again and the world had the benefit. In order to
keep up the price, the surplus stock was burned up
each year by certain unscrupulous men, as is proposed
to do at the present day with the surplus
stock of Brazilian coffee. In 1760, they burned at
Amsterdam three such immense piles of nutmegs
and cloves that one writer says: “Each of which
was as big as a church.”</p>

<p>This account of nutmeg would not be complete
without “Connecticut Nutmegs.” Some 90 years
ago Frederick Accum startled England with his book
“Adulteration of Food and Culinary Poison,” and a
sort of pure food hysteria passed thru the country
similar to that caused by the boric acid investigation
here. But he was eclipsed by a person who
declared that the makers of wooden shoe-pegs in
Connecticut were making oats and nutmegs from
the discarded wood of sawmills. He asserted they
were not only made, but used as food thruout the
country. Thus was Connecticut christened the Nutmeg
State, a name which it has retained even unto
this day.</p>

<span class="subhead sep">White and Black Varieties and Why—How the Plant
Is Cultivated and Where—History the Grocer
Should Know to Judge Qualities</span>
</h2>
</div>

<div class="sep"></div>

<p>Pepper is a commodity to be found in every grocery
store, but how many grocers know that the pepper
plant—Piper nigrum—which produces the white
and black pepper of commerce, is a climbing vine-like
shrub, found growing wild in the forests of Travanscore
and Malabar coast of India? It is extensively
cultivated in southwest India, whence it has
been introduced into Java, Borneo, the Malay peninsula,
Siam, the Philippines and the West Indies.</p>

<p>Pepper in the time of Alexander the Great was
considered an extremely choice article and, like gold
and precious stones, was for many generations found
only on royal tables. During the Middle Ages, it was
used as money in payment of tolls, etc., hence the
custom of “pepper corn” rentals, i. e., a nominal rental
or perpetual lease; and its high price is said to
have been one of the causes which led the Portuguese
to seek a sea passage to India.</p>

<p>The pepper plant grows naturally to 20 ft. in
height, but is cultivated on trellises or poles, about
10 or 12 ft. high and is propagated by cuttings or
suckers. It has a soft stem, the leaves are 4 to 6 in.
long, tough, glossy, broadly ovate, with 5 to 7 nerves,
and grow opposite and alternate to a pendulous spike
5 to 8 in. long, having 20 to 50 white flowers that
ripen into a one-seeded fruit with a fleshy exterior.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
This fleshy berry, covering a soft stone, is about the
size of a pea and is at first green, but in ripening
turns red, which gradually darkens to a deep chocolate
shade. The vine begins to bear when 3 or 4
years old and continues bearing for the next 10 or 15
years. It is in perfection at its eighth year.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.75em;">
<img src="images/i_p046.png" width="348" height="547" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There are two crops a year—July and December—which
yield 5 to 6 lbs. of dried pepper each for a
single vine. When the berries are ripe the stalk is
pinched off by hand and placed in an oblong cane
basket, slung horizontally behind the plucker by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
rope around his waist. The rounded ends of the
basket extend a little on either side, so that the
basket can be easily filled by either hand of the
workman. The berries are rubbed off the spikes by
hand and placed on mats or on the bare ground, to
dry in the sun, when the weather is fair. In damp
or cloudy weather they are placed in shallow, open
baskets before a gentle fire. If the berries are left
too long on the vines they lose part of their aromatic,
pungent hot taste, and if gathered too soon they
become broken and dusty in drying. After drying,
when they become black and shriveled up, they are
cleaned and winnowed. Good black pepper is firm
and not too deeply wrinkled, does not easily crumble
or break in the hand, it is also heavy and readily
sinks in water. The inner seed should be hard,
round and smooth and of a grayish-brown color. The
outside pericarp should be brownish-black. A yellow
tinge betrays over-ripeness and consequent loss
of strength. A reprehensible practice among some
dealers to hide defective peppers is to artificially
blacken them and polish with oil. The usual method
of judging quality is by weight, the grades technically
being known as heavy, or shot, half-heavy
and light peppers or corns. A one-litre measure may
be filled with the pepper and the contents weighed,
or 100 corns of average size counted and their weight
ascertained. The variations of peppers of different
qualities, according to their habitat, are given in the
following table:</p>

<table summary="varieties of peppers">

</table>

<p>It is evident that the moisture present in the corns
plays an important part in the determination of the
weight, and it will be necessary to bring the peppers
up to the stated water content by either drying
them or placing them in a moist atmosphere, or first
weigh them dry and weigh again. A slight variation,
however, from the figures given, is unavoidable.</p>

<p>Singapore Pepper—The principal part of this import
is the product of Sumatra, Borneo and Siam,
collected at Singapore. A considerable quantity,
however, is the products of the Straits Settlements
themselves. It is of large size and of a fairly uniform
quality, but as pepper powder it is not much esteemed,
owing to the manner of drying, giving it a smoky
flavor that buyers can distinguish Singapore pepper
from peppers grown elsewhere.</p>

<p>Tellicherry and Alleppey are much alike in appearance,
both being light brown in color. They too, like
the Malabar peppers, are sun-dried. Mangalore (India)
pepper is heavy, large, of a deep black color,
very clean, and of uniform size. When powdered it
is of a greenish-black appearance.</p>

<p>The pepper shipped from Penang is called Irang
pepper and is grown in Sumatra. From the east end
of the same island comes the Lampong pepper, but
this lacks uniformity, and is light in color. It is
also sun-dried. Long pepper is the fruit spike of
Chivaci Roxburgh, a native of Malabar and Chavica
officinarum, a native of the India archipelago; they
are both climbing plants. The first pods, or catkins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
about 1½ in. long, grow nearly straight, and opposite
the leaves. They are gathered before they are ripe
and dried in the sun, when they become brown or
dark green in color and rough to the touch. They
lack the pungency of the black variety. The long pepper
plant dies at the end of 3 years, and after the
fruit is collected the vine dies down to the ground.
The fruit grows so close together on the spike that
when ripe they become one solid mass. There is
also a variety of long pepper called elephant pepper.
Long peppers are mostly used for pickles. A medium,
called Pippua moola, is made from the roots
and stems; it is very stimulating.</p>

<p>Cubeb peppers are the berries of the vine Cubeb
officinalis, a product of Java, Borneo and Sumatra,
but mostly imported by way of Batavia and Canton.
They are of a gray color, about the size of black
pepper, somewhat longer, more wrinkled and with a
short slender stalk. They have a hot, camphor taste.
Another kind is distinguished by a mace-like odor
and taste. Cubebs are now mostly used as a medicine.</p>

<p>Ashantee or West African pepper is the dried berry
of a pepper plant which grows in tropical Africa. It
is smoother and smaller than the black pepper and
resembles the Cubeb very closely. In taste it resembles
the ordinary black pepper. At one time its
importation was forbidden by the king of Portugal,
as it threatened to interfere with the commerce of
India.</p>

<p>Betel pepper is the berry of Chavica betel, a species
of climbing vine largely cultivated in the East
Indies, Ceylon, Burma, Siam, etc. It furnishes the
leaves which are used along with arecanut and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
ingredients to compose the favorite stimulant chewing
mixture of the people of India.</p>

<p>White pepper is from the same plant as black
pepper, with the difference, that to make white pepper
the pepper corns are not picked until fully ripe;
they are then soaked in water for 7 or 8 days, or
heaped up so that the pulp ferments, then they are
rubbed by hand, or on a coarse cloth, if the quantity
be small, or trampled under foot if the quantity be
large; this operation deprives them of the pulpy
skin or husk, and the greenish-white seeds which remain
are the white peppers of commerce; then they
are re-dried, either in the sun or by artificial heat.
White pepper is bleached whiter by a chemical process.
If the berries be left on the vines until over-ripe
they lose their pulpy husk by natural decay and
thus become actually white pepper, altho in reality
they are the kernels of black pepper.</p>

<p>Singapore white are berries cultivated in the
neighboring islands and the husks are removed at
Singapore by hand and friction before the berries
are fully dried. Penang white is really grown at
Sumatra, but imported into Penang in a dried state.
There the berries are soaked in lime and water for
several weeks, until the pulp is soft, when it is rubbed
off by hand and washing; the berries are then
re-dried.</p>

<p>Siam white are berries prepared in the same manner
as Singapore white, from berries grown in Siam.</p>

<p>The dried black peppers, as imported, are also decorticated
or deprived of their husks by machinery,
the result being white pepper, which is sometimes
bleached.</p>

<p>The active properties of pepper are an acrid resin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
a volatile oil, and a crystallizable, colorless substance
called pipertine, or peperic. Why white pepper
should be preferred before the black is one of
the anomalies of the trade. White pepper has really
only about a quarter the strength of black pepper,
and is the least economical to use for these reasons:
(1) Because of being allowed to ripen it loses much
of its pungency. (2) Because it is deprived of the
outer skin or husk, which contains much of the constituents
which go to make good pepper. (3) Because
it contains scarcely a trace of piperin, one of
the most active principles of pepper. Pepper rapidly
deteriorates under atmospheric influences, and
large stocks should not be carried unless provisions
are made for storing it in air-tight receptacles, for,
unless this precaution is taken, the goods in a few
months will have lost their pungency, which is an
essential characteristic of good pepper.</p>

<p>Pepper is a stimulant, and used in moderate quantities
is an aid to digestion. In India an infusion of
it is used to create an appetite and as a cure for gout
and palsy. It is also used in cases of cholera-morbus.
A liniment is made from the berries for rheumatism,
and the root is employed as a tonic stimulant and cordial.</p>

<h2 id="CUMIN_OR_CUMMIN_SEED" class="sans">CUMIN, OR CUMMIN SEED<br />

<span class="subhead sep">Also Caraway, Coriander, Cardimons, Poppy, Aniseed,
Saffron and Turmeric Described.</span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3 class="sep">Cumin, or Cummin Seed</h3>

<p>The aromatic fruit or seed of a plant of the genus
Umbellefera. It is referred to in Scripture (Matt.
xxxiii:23). As salt was a symbol of friendship,
“shearers of salt and cummin” meant intimate
friends. The seeds are linear and flat on
one side and convex or striated on the other.
Their odor and properties resemble the caraway, or
anise seeds, and they are often called bastard anise.
They are used in Germany in bread, in Holland they
are frequently put into cheese. Norwegian anchovies
in kegs are frequently flavored with them, and they
are also used in making curry powder, as a carminative
flavoring, and in veterinary medicines, etc.</p>

<h3>Caraway Seed</h3>

<p>The caraway plant has a branching stem 2 or 3 ft.
high, with finely divided leaves and dense umbels
of white or pinkish white flowers. The leaves are
frequently used to flavor soup and the roots, which
taper like a parsnip, and when young are boiled and
eaten as a vegetable. The seeds are oblong, pointed at
both ends, thickest in the middle, striated on the
surface and of a crescent shape, they have an aromatic
smell and warm, pungent taste. From the
seeds is obtained a volatile oil called oil of caraway,
of a pale yellow color which turns dark with age;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
it is frequently adulterated with oil of cumin. After
the oil has been extracted the seeds are called
“drawn caraways,” and by way of deception are often
mixed with good caraway seeds. They can be told
by their shrunken, dark appearance. The color of the
English caraway seeds is a deep brown, those of
Germany and Holland are larger and of a light blue-brown
color, while those from Russia, Poland and
Bohemia are small, of a blackish brown color, and
mixed with a good deal of dirt. There is a variety
of a light brown color, about twice the size of the
English caraways, imported from Mogador.</p>

<p>Caraway seeds and oil are used medicinally, as a
flavoring by bakers and confectioners, in compounding
various liquors, particularly that known as Kummel,
and in making Scotch cavie, or caraway, comfits;
for this purpose the seeds are coated with sugar
and colored red, pink, blue, yellow, etc.</p>

<h3>Coriander.</h3>

<p>The word “coriander” is derived from the Greek
word Koriannon, a bed-bug, referring to the disagreeable
smell of the whole plant when fresh, but
the ripe and perfectly dried fruit has an agreeable
smell and a sweetish, aromatic taste. Its an annual
or bi-annual plant, of the genus Umbelliferce, native
of South Europe, with a branching stem 1 or 2 ft.
high. The lower leaves bipennate, the upper ones
being more compounded and divided into very narrow
divisions. The fruit is globose, containing round
slightly ribbed or ridged seeds, about as large as
black pepper, very light, of a yellowish brown or
straw color externally; inside the husk of each seed
are two closely fitting hemispherical mericarps.</p>

<p>The seeds are used in medicine as a carminative.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
They cover the taste of senna leaves better than
any other substance; are occasionally mixed with
curry powder; in domestic economy they are used
by confectioners and bakers as flavorings, being
often mixed with bread in the north of Europe. A
cordial is made from them, and they are used for
flavoring spirituous liquors, particularly gin.</p>

<h3>Cardamons.</h3>

<p>Cardamons consist of the seeds of two species of
plants, the Elettaria of Malabar and the Amomon of
China, Guinea and other parts of the East Indies. As
the seeds of the two species differ in some respects
we will describe the Ellettaria kind. The plant, which
grows 5 to 10 ft. high, has a reed-like habit and bear
long, loose racemes of flowers, succeeded by triangular
capsules, of a dirty white color, containing a
number of dark brown, angular seeds about the size
of mustard seeds. The capsules or fruits, which
vary from ½ in. to 2 in. in length, are collected from
wild plants and also from plantations, the latter being
generally laid out in partially cleared forests
in which the wild plants are known to occur. When
about 3 years old the plants begin to bear. The
capsules do not all ripen at the same time, and the
harvest lasts for nearly two months. The capsules
are gathered before they are ripe and then cured in
the sun, after which the stalks and remains of flowers
are carefully removed by means of scissors.
They are then graded into “shorts,” “short-longs,”
and “long-longs,” according to their length; sometimes
they are mixed and classed as lesser or greater
cardamons. Cardamon seeds are exported in the
capsules in order to prevent adulteration. The
seeds have a very delicate aroma and are slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
pungent. They were well known to the ancients,
and are used at present in medicine, particularly in
veterinary practice, also in flavoring culinary sauces,
soups, curries, cordials, pastry, and for imparting a
factitious strength to vinegar, beer, wines and
spirits, especially gin; their use creates a thirst.
The seeds depend for their quality on a pungent essential
oil, of which they contain about 3 per cent,
called oil of cardamons; they also contain about 10
per cent of a fixed oil. The seeds of the “Amomum”
species of cardamons are bright black in color outside,
white inside and small and angular in shape;
they are slightly aromatic, very hot and pungent.</p>

<p>Cardamons are known as grains of Paradise,
Melegueta pepper, Guinea grains and Guinea pepper.</p>

<h3>Poppy Seeds</h3>

<p>Poppy seeds are not unlike fine gunpowder in general
appearance, being very small, dark blue—nearly
black in color; they are obtained from the same
plant that yields opium (Papavar somnniferium, or
white poppy.) The seeds are not narcotic, and have
a sweet taste, are oleaginous and nutritious. They
are largely used in some parts of Europe in pastry,
confectionery and as a substitute for almonds. Under
the name of “Maw seeds,” they are sold as food for
birds during moulting season. Poppy seed oil is
sometimes used as an adulterant in olive oil; it is
also used as an illuminant and for painting.</p>

<h3>Fennel</h3>

<p>Fennel is a tall, stout, aromatic herb of the parsley
family, with finely dissected leaves, which are
boiled and served with salmon, mackerel, etc., as a
seasoning; the flowers are yellow. A species—F.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
dulce—is cultivated in Italy as celery is with us;
and its blanched stems are said to be more tender
and delicate than celery, with a slight flavor of
fennel. The seeds of another species—F. panmorium—grown
in Bengal, have a warmish, very sweet
taste and aromatic smell, and are used in making
betel, in curries, and also used as a carminative.
Fennel seeds resemble aniseeds in appearance and
taste, and are often sold for such; they are a little
longer and of a light brown color. The Indian seeds
are the largest, the Italian and Japanese the smallest.
They are used in confectionery, cookery and are
sometimes chewed by the people of France and Germany.
Fennel water is made from the oil obtained
from the seeds.</p>

<h3>Aniseed</h3>

<p>Aniseed is an annual plant of the order of Umbelliferae
of the parsley family, a native of Egypt,
but also extensively cultivated in Russia, Germany,
Malta and Spain. Aniseed is very similar in appearance
to the poisonous hemlock seed, for which it has
sometimes been mistaken. The seed, which is a little
larger than a pin’s head, is of a greyish-green
color. They have an aromatic smell, and warm,
sweetish taste, and are used in condiments, in cookery
and in the preparation of liquors, also in medicine
as a stimulative stomachic to relieve flatulence,
etc., particularly in infants. The properties of aniseed
are due to a nearly colorless or sometimes blue
volatile oil. Aniseed oil with water and sugar is
much used in Italy as a cooling drink. The leaves of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
the plant are sometimes used as a seasoning and for
garnishing.</p>

<p>Star aniseed, or China aniseed, is the fruit of a
small evergreen tree of the order Magnoliacae, somewhat
resembling a laurel. It receives its name from
the star-like form of the fruit or capsule, which consists
of a number (6 to 12) of hard, woody, one-sided
follicies or carpels ending in a point, each containing
a single brown, shiny seed. Star aniseed is held in
high esteem by the Japanese and is planted near their
temples, the seeds being burned as incense in the
temples and over the graves of relatives. The whole
plant is carminative, and is used by the Chinese as
a stomachic and as a spice in their cookery. The
qualities of the seed and oil closely resemble those
of the common aniseed and the oil is exported to
Europe for the same purpose—flavoring liquors.</p>

<h3>Saffron</h3>

<p>Consists of the dried stigmas of the autumn or fall
crocus plant (crocus sativus), which should not be
confounded with the spring crocus (crocus vernus),
to which it is nearly allied. The crocus derives its
name from Crogeus—which is from the Greek word
Krokus, yellow—the modern Korghy in Cilicune,
where it was grown in ancient times. The word
“crocodile” is derived from the Greek words Krokos,
yellow, and deilos, fearful, on the ancient supposition
the animal avoided the place where saffron grows
and only sheds real tears when in the vicinity of
a crocus field, hence Fuller says: “The crocodile
tears are never true, save he is forced where saffron
groweth.” The phrase, “crocodile tears,” arose from
the idea that the crocodile pretended to cry over the
victims it had devoured. Saffron was of great importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
ages ago. It is mentioned in the third chapter
of Solomon’s Songs; it was in favor among the
ancient Greeks as a dye, and with both them and the
Romans as a perfume. The streets of Rome were
sprinkled with saffron when Nero made his entry
into that city. In the middle ages it was employed
in cookery and as a drug, and it is on record that
as late as the fifteenth century persons were burned
alive in Muremburg for adulterating saffron. It was
introduced to England in 1339 from Tripoli by a
pilgrim who had a stolen bulb in the hollow of his
staff. Its main use was to color pastry and confectionery,
hence: “I must have saffron to color the
warden pies” (Shakespeare’s Winter’s Tale, act 4,
scene 1). The town of Saffron Waldron in Essex,
derives its name from the fact of its being cultivated
in that neighborhood until 1768. The cultivation of
the crocus for saffron in England has entirely died
out; altho the people of Cornwall at the present day
use more saffron than all the rest of Great Britain.
It is cultivated in China, Cashmere, Persia, Asia
Minor, Egypt, Austria, Hungary, Russia, Italy, France,
but the chief source of supply is Spain.</p>

<p>A saffron field is not in full bearing until the end
of the second year, at the end of the third year it is
exhausted, and it is said that the soil is so poisoned
that it cannot be used for any other crops for several
years. Each acre produces from 600,000 to 700,000
bulbs and each bulb 2 or 3 flowers. About 150,000
flowers are required to produce 2 lbs. of fresh pistils,
which when dried are reduced to one-fifth of that
weight.</p>

<p>The small yield, the labor required, the care in
culture and the difficulty of preserving the product in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
a good state renders saffron an expensive article—about
80c an ounce. On the seed-bearer of the flower
there is a thread-like hook or fork, which at its upper
head terminates in three thick, dark, orange-colored
nerves or tissues; to save and collect these tissues
the flowers are gathered in the fall, just as they are
breaking, or a little before; they are plucked early
in the morning, and these little masses are then
pulled out with a considerable portion—about 1¼ in.
of thread-like stem, to which they adhere. They are
then dried over little charcoal fires or in the sun.
It is this dried stigma, the trifid orange-colored tops
of the central organ of the flower, that is the saffron
of commerce. The remainder of the flower is useless.</p>

<p>Saffron as it generaly comes to the trade consists
of a large number of crooked and mixed-up threads,
of an orange-red color; it has a peculiar, sharp, rooty
and pungent smell, and a bitter balsam-like taste;
that of a whitish yellow or blackish color is old and
inferior. The great solubility of saffron prevents its
use as a dye for fabrics, its place being taken by
aniline dyes. Its coloring power is remarkable, a
single grain rubbed to a fine powder with a little
sugar will impart a distinct tint of yellow to 10 gals,
of water; soaked in spirits or warm water it will
yield three-fourths of its weight of a deep orange
yellow coloring matter, which is perfectly wholesome,
and if kept tightly corked will keep for some time.
The chief uses of saffron are for flavoring and coloring
confectionery and culinary articles; it is also
used as a perfume and is given to birds during the
moulting season. Spanish saffron is divided into five
grades, according to the district in which it is cultivated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
It is generally wrapped in tinfoil and then
in white tissue paper and packed in tin boxes or
strong cartons.</p>

<p>On account of its high price saffron is often counterfeited
or adulterated with the petals of safflowers,
African saffron, Meadow or wild saffron, marigold,
arnica, etc. It is also loaded with glycerine, glucose,
dyed vegetable filamenta, honey, sulphate of soda,
barium sulphate, etc., and exhausted saffron is sometimes
re-colored with aniline dye. The stigma of
genuine saffron immediately expands on being moistened
with warm water, and its form is so characteristic
that it cannot be mistaken for the flowerets of
any of its adulterates.</p>

<p>Cake saffron is generally made from the dried flowers
of the safflowers—a thistle-like plant of the aster
family—or the florets of the saffron plants made into
a paste with gum-water; it is used for dying and making
rouge.</p>

<h3>Turmeric</h3>

<p>Turmeric is an East Indian plant (curcuma longa)
of the ginger family, with the same properties as
ginger, only not so powerful. It is also grown in
Zanzibar, China and the Malayan archipelago. It
is a stemless plant with dark green leaves varying
from 6 in. to 24 in. long and 3 in. to 6 in. wide,
flowers of a dull yellow color and a tuberous root
varying in thickness from that of a quill to ½ in.
in diameter and often a foot long, with joints or ring-like
swellings at short intervals; of, a yellowish to
orange color outside and sometimes white and sometimes
orange color inside. They are classed as long
or round tubes according to their shape. From the
root is made a kind of arrowroot much relished by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
the natives of India to color their faces. In medicine
it is used as a cordial or stomachic; as an anti-scorbutic,
and for stimulating the digestive organs. In a
fresh state it is given to expel intestinal worms and
in diarrhoea. It is used in varnishes and ointments
and as a dye for silks and woolens, but it is now
chiefly employed in making Indian curries or pickles,
mustard, compounds, pudding spices, chow-chow pickles.
A kind growing in Bengal, called “Mango ginger,”
from its resemblance to the mango, is used for
the same purpose as ginger.</p>

<p>Turmeric paper is a bibulous paper, yellow from
saturation with the extract of turmeric, used as a test
for alkalies, by which it is turned brown or red. Turmeric
is also made from the roots of the canna, a
member of the same family of plants cultivated at
Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>Turmeric is adulterated with yellow ocher and carbonate
of soda. Turmeric is insoluble in cold water,
only partly soluble in boiling water, but is quite
soluble in alcohol, forming beautiful yellow crystals.</p>

<h3>Nasturtium</h3>

<p>The flower buds and fruits of the common garden
nasturtium are often used as a spice after being
ground and dried; they are also pickled like capers
and used on fish, meats, etc. The name is derived
from nausa, nose, and tortus, twist, from the effects
of its pungent smell or taste.</p>
